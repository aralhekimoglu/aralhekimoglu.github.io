Active learning description

My research interests touch especially the area of active learning in the field of robotics. So I try to apply machine learning techniques to the problem of autonomous robotics. This includes especially -- but is not limited to -- Bayesian techniques. In our curious robot project we experiment on autonomous exploration on our PR2 robot and use our active learning insights directly on real world problems. We are especially interested on degrees of freedom in the world and how robot could explore them and their structure to achieve task goals.

- Designed a new person re-identification model to improve performance of the model in-use by +16% by proposing a part-based generator network to generate more realistic looking pedestrian images.
- Organized experiments in PyTorch to compare performance and image quality that resulted in reduction in complexity of the backbone network which doubled the speed at test time.
- Participated in entire R&D cycle: coding the network, data loading, training in a Nvidia-Docker container, conversion to a deployable TensorRT Caffe model, integrating with surveillance system in C++.

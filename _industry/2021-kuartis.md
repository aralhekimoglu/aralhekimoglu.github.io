- Researched Active Learning methods for data-efficient model development. Researched method helped 2D Object Detection deep learning model achieve peak performance with 30% less training data.
- Constructed an Active Learning based pipeline consisting of data selection, training dataset creation and model training that helped engineers spend less time on data preparation processes and more on model development.
- Worked on training and implementation of multiple autonomous driving perception models including: 2D Object Detection, Lane Detection, Point Cloud Segmentation, Perception Fusion and Motion Prediction.
- Deployed various neural network models using TensorRT and C++ 11 for faster inference running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX and ROS.
- Participated in design and decision making process of full perception architecture for a self-driving car.

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student researching data-efficient deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks in the autonomous driving industry. I am currently working at BMW in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Gerhard Rigoll from Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Munich.

I earned my MSc in Computer Science at New York University focusing on computer vision. Later, for a year, I worked at a start-up as a Computer Vision Engineer specializing in autonomous driving perception systems.

Please feel free to contact if you want to know more about me!

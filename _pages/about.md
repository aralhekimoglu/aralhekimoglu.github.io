I am currently pursuing my PhD at a collaboration program of BMW Group and Technical University of Munich. My research area is finding data-efficient development solutions for various autonomous driving tasks.

I finished my MSc of Computer Science at New York University focusing on computer vision. Later, for a year, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer specializing on autonomous driving perception systems.
